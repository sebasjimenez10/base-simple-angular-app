# Base Simple Angular App

Sample application based on the tutorial [Single page routing and templating](https://scotch.io/tutorials/single-page-apps-with-angularjs-routing-and-templating) and [Animating AngularJS App: ngView](https://scotch.io/tutorials/animating-angularjs-apps-ngview) from [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io). Added some custom stuff based on [A collection of page transitions](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/05/07/a-collection-of-page-transitions/) which helped choose the animation effects.

Used [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) as server and [express js](http://expressjs.com/) as web framework. Finally, used some [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for making it look less ugly.
